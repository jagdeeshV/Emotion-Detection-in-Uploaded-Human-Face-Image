Emotion Detection from Uploaded Human Face Images
</h1>
[ Python Project - Kaggle FER-2013 data set training, CNN architecture & training techniques,  Streamlit, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch. ]

### Project Objective
Develop an endto-end comprehensive system that enables users to upload image and accurately detect and classify the emotion present in the image using Convolutional
 Neural Networks (CNNs)

This project aims to develop and design, implement, and optimize a complete solution that integrates machine learning, computer vision, and user interface design.

### Approach
 An End-to-End Development: Right from setting up the image upload interface to training the CNN model and delivering a polished, user-friendly application.
  1.	**Train and fine-tune** a CNN model using FER-2013 dataset available in the Kaggle.   
	 •  Evaluate the model’s performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
	 •  Experiment with different CNN architectures and training techniques to maximize the model’s accuracy.
	 • Implementoptimizations to ensure the system runs efficiently and delivers results in real-time.    	

  2. ***User Interface:***. 
	 • Designed a Streamlit application that validates and accepts user's uploaded face images. and predicts the emotion.
	 • On test basis designed a Streamlit application to read webcam face video and to the emotion.

### Technologies used and Pre-requisites


1.	** Python: ** The programming language used for building the application and scripting tasks.

    Visit the URL  [Download Python | Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)    to download and install python in the PC

    **Install necessary Python packages / Libraries:** Install the necessary frameworks / libraries using pip or conda package manager. Required libraries include Streamlit, Pandas,  OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch

2.	**Streamlit:** Streamlit is an open-source Python framework designed to create and share web applications. It is specifically built for Python, making it easy for data scientists and machine learning engineers to deploy their models and visualize data without needing extensive knowledge of web development.
	
        Web-based user interface/s developed using Streamlit for face emotion Prediction.

### Executing the Application 

To run the project, follow these steps:

1.	Install Python and required Framework / libraries as given above
